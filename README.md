# Welcome to Gamify your Day! Let's get through our daily chores the fun way!

## What is our purpose?

Gamify your Day is an app meant to help anyone - in particular those who struggle with mood or mental disorders - get through their daily tasks in a more engaging and fun way!

## How do I use this app?

This app is [live](https://gamifyyourday.netlify.app/) and you can use it anytime!
This app was designed with a mobile view in mind - please either use the console to toggle a mobile view, an extension for mobile view, or even better, check it out on your mobile!

1. Simply select the chores that you feel like tackling today.
2. Select a pet you'd like to feed. Each pet has different hunger (difficulty) levels.
3. Select the time for each task, according to how long you think you'd take to accomplish it.
4. Once satisfied with your time and pet selection, you can start the game! One of the tasks you selected will be randomly assigned to you.
5. Off you go! The timer will count down. Finishing the task in time and clicking on "I'm done!" will award you with apples to feed your pet!
6. If you accumulate all necessary apples for your pet, you win the game! Don't worry though, if you still have tasks to finish or would like to do more, you are free to do so!

This is an eternal WIP - please feel free to reach out to the collaborators of this project if you find bugs or would like to make suggestions! :D
